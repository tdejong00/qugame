# QuGame: An Educational Quantum Game

QuGame is an educational 3D-game created using Godot Engine, where players can
become more familiar with simple quantum computing. At the moment, the game is
limited to single-qubit systems. The game includes three tutorial levels, which
introduce the player to quantum computing and showcase how different quantum
gates work. After completing the tutorial levels, players unlock a Sandbox Mode
where they can play around freely.
